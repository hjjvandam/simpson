# SIMPSON 

SIMPSON is a solid state NMR program [1,2]. According to the references [1] this package
was released under GPL, but the none of repositories mentioned are currently accessible.
This repository is a best effort attempt to provide this code in a usable form. This
repository was forked from [Vosegaard's](https://github.com/vosegaard/simpson) but that
one is missing various pieces needed to build and test the code.

SIMMOL is a recommended companion program for setting calculations up [3,4].

More information is available on the developer's web-site [5].
