# Simpson 

Simpson is a solid state NMR program [1]. According to the references [1] this package
was released under GPL, but the none of repositories mentioned are currently accessible.
This repository is a best effort attempt to provide this code in a usable form. This
repository was forked from (Vosegaard's)[https://github.com/vosegaard/simpson] but that
one is missing various pieces needed to build and test the code.
